Besides, they had been intended to stand in for a traveling trophy, but with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520Tricky.html">The Tricky</a> there's now an actual trophy that doesn't need international shipping multiple times a year.

Myke proposes an upgrade to the "chosen title" system as a result: if a host has both Flexie crowns, he may use a more prestigious title. The titles are: "King Flexie" for Federico, "Archduke of Flexington" for Myke, and, after consulting the line of succession and discovering that the next higher in line for the US Presidency is the Secretary of Defense, "Secretary of Deflex" for Stephen.</li></ul></li>

<ul>
<li>The pick reuse rule is discussed in depth, and ultimately gets relaxed a bit further. For Keynote games, hosts may not reuse <em>their own</em> picks from either the last Keynote event or the ongoing Annual game, but all other picks are available, including the picks of other hosts in any previous game. When picking for the Annual games, hosts may not reuse their own picks from the last year's game. As before, Flexies are always reusable. (The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Ineligible%2520Picks.html">Ineligible Picks</a> page has been updated once again with each host's currently restricted picks.)</li></ul></li>

<li>Reuse of picks is revisited, and is <a href="https://overcast.fm/+FXx6Hkxs4/21:54" target="_blank">changed to be allowed after a year has passed</a>.

<li>Myke <a href="https://overcast.fm/+FXx7YIi-0/42:01" target="_blank">notices that the rules do not identify when keynote picks can come true</a>, and proposes that the window open at the start of the event and close at grading. (He also noted this in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Connected%2520%2523311%253A%2520The%2520Rickies%2520%2528September%25202020%2529.html">#311</a> and <a href="https://overcast.fm/+FXx5XgcdI/1:05:54" target="_blank">proposed a similar rule change</a>, but it was never written down.) Stephen prefers starting at the publication of the prediction episode, but Federico breaks the tie in Myke's favor, agreeing that it is a competition about the event. Unlike <a href="https://upgrade.cards/" target="_blank">the Keynote Draft</a> on <a href="https://relay.fm/upgrade" target="_blank">Upgrade</a>, which only allows information from the presentation itself, ancillary material is allowed. For example, a specifications page that clarifies details may figure into grading as long as it is available at that time.</li>

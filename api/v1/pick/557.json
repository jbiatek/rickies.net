  "notes": "<p><ul><li>Stephen came to the table with two picks: \"Apple announces a multi-device charger that looks a lot like AirPower\" and \"The 15 Pro Max weighs within 10% of the 14 Pro Max's weight\". Myke believed that a 10% margin on either side is too wide to be risky and also that the AirPower one is just a better risky pick with less math. Once it's settled to go with the AirPower one, Federico asks to clarify \"looks like\" and the pick is modified to specify a lack of charging targets..</li></ul></p>",

Stephen proposes a placating half point, but Myke stands firm that \"there are no half points around here.\" This seems to be the last time that half points were ever considered for a pick.</li><li>The big iWork update <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/all-new-ipad-air-and-ipad-mini-deliver-dramatic-power-and-capability/\" target=\"_blank\">eventually came in 2019</a>.</li></ul></p>",

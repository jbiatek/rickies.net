MagSafe charging speed will also be raised from 15 watts.\"</li><li>Originally didn't include the last sentence.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/06/apple-reverse-wireless-charging-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">previous rumors of reverse wireless charging</a> didn't disqualify this pick since it's in combination with Qi 2 as well. It's pointed out that Qi 2 is basically just standardized MagSafe as well, but it's still allowed as they'll have to be specific about Qi 2 to count it. Stephen still thinks it lacks passion. Later, Federico <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+FXx5s-OzI/1:05:12\" target=\"_blank\">sprinkled some passion on it after all</a> by adding a charging wattage increase after all.</li></ul></p>",

Federico provides some insider information indicating that the setting does exist, but can it be said to have \"come true\", as the rule states, without proof? The meaning of truth itself is debated, perhaps a philosophical high point for the Rickies. The point is ultimately granted, with the understanding that in the future, the rules will be amended to clarify that picks must be publicly verifiable to earn points.</li></ul></p>",

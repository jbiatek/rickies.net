# Rickipedia

The comprehensive collection of picks and predictions about the Rickies, an
Apple predictions game played on [Connected](https://relay.fm/connected/).

[View the actual site itself here](https://rickies.net/). 

The page is almost entirely contained in index.html. I edit it by running a 
TiddlyWiki Node server and exporting an "offline" copy for the published site.
It's all completely static, including searching, because it's implemented in
JavaScript and TiddlyWiki sites contain all the code, styling, and data.
The only external resources are the favicons and site logo.

Corrections and clarifications are more than welcome, just file an issue here
on GitHub. Pull requests are probably going to be difficult to integrate, so
opening an issue with the relevant information is preferred.
